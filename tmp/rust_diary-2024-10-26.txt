                    document.getElementById('sidebar').setAttribute('aria-hidden', sidebar !== 'visible');
                    Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('#sidebar a')).forEach(function(link) {
                        link.setAttribute('tabIndex', sidebar === 'visible' ? 0 : -1);
                    }); Introduction Welcome to the Smithay Handbook. This is a work in progress, and intended to serve as a general manual for building Wayland-related
software in Rust, using the tools from the Smithay project . The project revolves around 3 main components: The wayland-rs repository contains low-level bindings to the
Wayland protocols, under the form of several crates. The two most notable being wayland-client and wayland-server , which are the core bindings for client-side
and server-side apps. SCTK , or Smithay Client ToolKit, is a crate designed
to handle a significant portion of the plumbing required for writing Wayland client apps. It comes on top
of wayland-client, and this book will present it as well. Smithay is the flagship crate of the project, and is designed as
a framework for writing Wayland servers (also called compositors). It is built on top of the wayland-server
crate, and also handles most of the interaction with the system (input devices, graphics, udev, sessions, ...). The first part of this book is dedicated to client-side apps, while the second part focuses of server-side.
If you are interested by the server-side stuff, it is recommended to first get familiar with the client-side,
as it is easier to get into and a lot of its concepts map to server-side.

Repository files navigation README Apache-2.0 license MIT license Fennec: The Oxidized PHP Toolchain Fennec is a toolchain for PHP that aims to provide a set of tools to help developers write better code.
It is inspired by the Rust programming language and its toolchain, and aims to provide similar functionality for PHP. Disclaimer Warning Fennec is in an early stage of development. Many features are not yet implemented, and existing functionality may change, break, or stop working without notice.
While we are not actively promoting or advertising the project, we are working in public to share our progress with the community. Roadmap Core Functionality String Interning: crates/interner Lexer: crates/lexer crates/token AST: crates/node crates/ast Parser: crates/parser Source Management: crates/source AST Traversal / Walk: crates/traverser crates/walker Name Resolution: crates/names Code Fixer: crates/fixer Error Reporting: crates/reporting Semantic Analysis: crates/semantics Symbol Table: crates/symbol-table Linter: crates/linter Configuration: crates/config String Case Conversion: crates/casing Formatter Static Analyzer Refactoring Code Generation Documentation Generation Docblock Parser crates/docblock Test Runner Tooling CLI Tool: src/main.rs - In Progress, Basic Functionality Implemented. Web Interface Language Server Protocol Editor Integration Installation cargo install --git https://github.com/carthage-software/fennec Installation from source git clone https://github.com/carthage-software/fennec cd fennec
cargo install --path . Usage For a quick start, you can refer to the example configuration files provided: Simple configuration: examples/fennec.toml Full configuration with all possible options: examples/fennec-full.toml You can try Fennec by navigating to the examples directory and running the linter on the sample PHP files: cd examples
fennec lint This will analyze the PHP files located in the examples/src/ directory and display any linting errors. How You Can Help Fennec is a community-driven project, and we’d love for you to join us! Here are some ways you can contribute: Suggest Ideas : Have an idea for Fennec? We’re open to suggestions that can make the toolchain even better! Help Write Documentation : Clear, user-friendly documentation is key to making Fennec accessible to everyone. If you enjoy writing or organizing docs, we'd love your help. Contribute Code : Join us in building Fennec! Please discuss any feature or bug fixes in the issues first to ensure we coordinate effectively. Sponsor the Project : If you’d like to support Fennec financially, consider sponsoring @azjezz . Every contribution helps! Help with Art : Fennec could use a logo! We’d appreciate the help of a skilled artist to create an original logo for Fennec. (Please note that AI-generated art will not be accepted.) Inspiration Fennec is inspired by several tools and projects that have significantly contributed to the development community: Clippy : A collection of lints to catch common mistakes and improve your Rust code. OXC : A JavaScript toolchain written in Rust. php-rust-tools/parser : A PHP parser written in Rust, which influenced our parsing approach. slackhq/hakana : A static analysis tool for HackLang written in Rust, by the creator of Psalm . These tools have inspired us and helped shape Fennec's design and functionality. Acknowledgements We would like to acknowledge the following PHP tools that have greatly helped hundreds of thousands of PHP developers in their journey,
ourselves included: PHP CS Fixer : A tool to automatically fix PHP Coding Standards issues. Psalm : A static analysis tool for finding errors in PHP applications. PHPStan : PHP Static Analysis Tool. PHP_CodeSniffer : Detects violations of a defined set of coding standards. While Fennec is intended to be a comprehensive toolchain that may eventually replace some of these tools,
we deeply appreciate their contributions and the foundation they have built for the PHP community. License Fennec is licensed under either of MIT License (MIT) - see LICENSE-MIT file for details Apache License, Version 2.0 (Apache-2.0) - see LICENSE-APACHE file for details at your option. Contribution Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in Fennec by you shall be dual licensed as above, without any additional terms or conditions. Thank you for your interest in Fennec. We look forward to sharing our progress and collaborating with the community as the project evolves.

Repository files navigation README Apache-2.0 license Motion🍃 Motion is a bare metal physics engine with which you can make simulations easily and quickly, also in rust. Get started ✨ let's start by making a simple event loop use std :: { thread , time :: Duration } ; use motion :: event_loop :: { EventLoop , EventLoopConfig } ; // The definition of this function depends on the context in which motion is used fn sleep ( duration : Duration ) { thread :: sleep ( duration ) ; } fn main ( ) { let el = EventLoop :: new ( EventLoopConfig { fps : 1 } ) ; el . start ( |_config| println ! ( "Hello! in the event loop" ) , sleep ) ; } now we are going to do something more complex by creating an object let mut obj = obj2d ( vec2 ( 75.0 , 200.0 ) , 2.0 , 2.0 , vec2 ( 2.0 , 231.0 ) , vec2 ( 2.0 , - 240.0 ) , 20.0 , Shape :: Circle , ) ; Why rust 🦀 Rust is a fast and efficient programming language, which makes it perfect for motion, plus it is very flexible allowing motion to be used everywhere.

Repository files navigation README Apache-2.0 license ContainerYard ContainerYard is a declarative, reproducible, and reusable decentralized approach for defining containers. Think Nix flakes meets Containerfiles (aka Dockerfiles). ContainerYard breaks Containerfiles into modules. Modules represent some specific functionality of a container. e.g. The rust module defines rust's installation. Modules also support Tera templating. A yard.yaml file is used to compose modules into Containerfiles. # yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcmah309/containeryard/master/src/schemas/yard-schema.json inputs : # Modules found on local paths modules : finalizer : local_modules/finalizer # Modules found in a remote repos remotes :
    - url : https://github.com/mcmah309/yard_module_repository commit : 992eac4ffc0a65d7e8cd30597d93920901fbd1cd modules : base : bases/ubuntu/base git_config : independent/git_config bash_flavor : apt/bash_interactive/flavors/mcmah309 outputs : # Output Containerfile created from modules Containerfile : # Module "base" from inputs - base : # Inputs, shell commands `$(..)` and ENV vars `$..` also supported version : " 24.04 " # Inline modules - RUN apt install git - git_config : user_name : $(git config --get user.name) email : $(git config --get user.email) - bash_flavor :
    - finalizer : hooks : build : # Command executed before the build. Will reload this file after the command is executed pre : yard update post : echo Done To compose the modules defined in yard.yaml into Containerfiles, simply run yard build . .
Which in the above case, will output a single Containerfile to your current directory. Declaring A Simple Module A module consists of a Tera template named Containerfile and a yard-module.yaml file
that defines configuration options and dependencies of the template. Containerfile FROM alpine:{{ version | default (value= "latest" ) }} RUN apk update \
    && apk upgrade \
    && apk add --no-cache ca-certificates \
    && update-ca-certificates yard-module.yaml # yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcmah309/containeryard/master/src/schemas/yard-module-schema.json description : " This is a modules description " args : required : optional :
    - version # Files to be pulled in with this module required_files : For more module examples click here . Installation Note: yard is the cli tool for ContainerYard. Debian - Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS, etc. RELEASE_VER= < INSERT_CURRENT_VERSION > # e.g. RELEASE_VER='v0.2.6' deb_file= " containeryard_ $( echo $RELEASE_VER | sed ' s/^v// ' ) -1_amd64.deb " curl -LO https://github.com/mcmah309/containeryard/releases/download/ $RELEASE_VER / $deb_file dpkg -i " $deb_file " Cargo cargo install containeryard Why Use ContainerYard? Developers constantly rewrite the same Containerfile/Dockerfile configs. Besides taking away developer time,
these configs become hard to maintain/upgrade and adding new features feels like starting from scratch again.
The goal of ContainerYard is to foster a library ecosystem of composable Containerfile modules. Users
can then import these various modules with little to no configuration. Want Rust? Just add it to your yard.yaml file.
Want Flutter? Do the same. With ContainerYard you should never have to define certain Containerfile configs again. But
if you do want to do something custom, ContainerYard does not get in your way, everything is Containerfile based
and the output is a pure Containerfile. No need to learn a complex tool, no need to re-invent the wheel, Containerfiles
and Tera templates are powerful enough. Just let ContainerYard be the glue. Why Use Container Yard Over Nix Flakes Nix flakes guarantees reproducibility at the cost of developer flexibility. Container Yard is decentralized, allowing users to easily use different package managers and upstreams. As such, Container Yard sacrifices some reproducibility guarantees and gains complete developer flexibility. Container Yard is also extremely simple and built on familiar developer tools - Containerfiles and Tera templates. Contributing Feel free to open an issue with any suggestions/ideas/bugs you may have and/or create PR's. ContainerYard builds and uses its own dev container :D see here .
Open the project in vscode, click the "open in container" button and you are ready to go! Otherwise just use the provided Containerfile or your own local setup.

Repository files navigation README Code of conduct Apache-2.0 license Security Ygen - Yet another Code Generator Welcome to Ygen!
This repository contains the source code of the ygen project. Ygen is a toolkit for building fast and clean compilers using a memory safe api. Why ygen? You are probably wondering: why would I choose ygen and not llvm or cranelift??
Here are a few reasons: Simplicity : One of ygens main focus is simplicity which means to us that as much code as possible is readable and shared Similare API : Ygens API is very similar to LLVMs API for example i designed the IRBuilder to be very similar to the Builder from LLVM Traits : Ygen uses a lot of traits to overload functions. Great examples are the Build... functions from the IRBuilder to build ir nodes Warning This project is still early in its developement. Bugs and miscompilations are expected. ONLY USE YGEN FOR TOY COMPILERS Contributions Simple example Here is a simple example on how to use Ygen to build an add function: use std :: error :: Error ; use Ygen :: prelude :: * ; pub fn main ( ) -> Result < ( ) , Box < dyn Error > > { let mut module = Module ( ) ; let mut builder = IRBuilder ( ) ; let ty = FnTy ( vec ! [ TypeMetadata :: i32 , TypeMetadata :: i32 ] , TypeMetadata :: i32 ) ; let func = module . add ( "add" , & ty ) ; func . extrn ( ) ; // make function externally visible let entry = func . addBlock ( "entry" ) ; builder . positionAtEnd ( entry ) ; let val = builder . BuildAdd ( ty . arg ( 0 ) , ty . arg ( 1 ) ) ; builder . BuildRet ( val ) ; module . verify ( ) . print ( ) ; eprintln ! ( "{}" ,
        module.dumpColored ( ) ) ; Ok ( ( ) ) } When executed this simple program builds an add function and dumps it's ir: define i32 @add ( i32 %0 , i32 %1 ) {
 entry: %2 = add i32 %0 , %1 ret i32 %2 } You can add following lines (you need to include std::fs::Path ) to compile the IR down to assembly: module . emitToAsmFile ( Triple :: host ( ) , & mut initializeAllTargets ( Triple :: host ( ) ) ? , Path :: new ( "out.asm" ) ) ? ; Support Ygen currently supports following architectures Name Full ir Full isa x64 Yes No Copyright This project is owned by Cr0a3 and licensed under the Apache2 License

New Privacy Policy. Please take a moment to read it × Last changed on: 2024-06-19, 4:09:59 p.m. ( diff ) Compiler Explorer Privacy Policy Thanks for your interest in what Compiler Explorer does with your data. Data protection is really
important to the Compiler Explorer team, and we want to be very clear about what we do with your data. Who we are Compiler Explorer was created by and is primarily administrated by Matt Godbolt , along with a number of volunteers (including, but not limited to those listed in our " Authors " documentation).
It is run on a best-effort basis, and is not a commercial product. We do our best
to keep your data safe, but welcome help from the community: See our GitHub project page if you wish to help. Your data In order to process compilation and execution requests, your browser sends the source code you typed in the editor
window along with your chosen compiler and options to the Compiler Explorer servers. There, the source code is
written to disk and your chosen compiler is invoked on it. If your request was to have your code executed, the
resulting executable is run. The outputs from compilation and execution are processed and sent back to your web
browser, where they're shown. Shortly after this process completes, your source code is deleted from disk. If, in
processing your query, an issue with Compiler Explorer is found, your code may be kept for up to a week in order to
help debug and diagnose the problem. Only the Compiler Explorer team will have access to your code, and only for the
purposes of debugging the site: we will never share your code with anyone. The source code and options are also subject to a one-way hash, which is used to cache the results to speed up
subsequent compilations of the same code. The cache is in-memory and on-disk. It's impossible to reconstruct the
source code from the hash, but the resulting assembly code or binary output (the compilation result) is stored as
plain text. There's no way to enumerate the in-memory cache contents. In exceptional cases, administrator members of
the Compiler Explorer team may be able to enumerate the disk caches and retrieve the compilation output, but with no
way to trace it back to the source code. In short: your source code is stored in plaintext for the minimum time feasible to be able to process your request.
After that, it is discarded and is inaccessible. In very rare cases your code may be kept for a little longer (at
most a week) to help debug issues in Compiler Explorer. Short links If you choose to share your code using the "Share" dropdown, then the user interface state including the source code
is stored. For a "Full" link, this information is encoded into the URL as a URL hash (e.g. https://godbolt.org/#ui_state_and_code ). For short URLs, the interface state is stored on
Compiler Explorer's servers, and a shortened name uniquely
referring to this data is returned. The shortened name comes from a secure hash of the state, and without
knowing the name it is infeasible to access the data. Only Compiler Explorer administrators can access this data
directly. Obfuscated IP addresses and creation time are stored alongside this data, to enable spam detection.
Links of this form look like https://godbolt.org/z/SHORTNAME . Prior to storing data itself, Compiler Explorer used an external URL shortening service ( goo.gl ) and the resulting short URL was rewritten as https://godbolt.org/g/SHORTURLPART .
The storage for the user experience state in this case remains with the short URL provider,
not Compiler Explorer. Application, web and error logs Compiler Explorer keeps application logs, which contain semi-anonymised IP addresses, but no other personally
identifying information. When a long URL is clicked, the hash part of the URL is not sent to the server, so the user
state (including the source code) is NOT exposed in the web log. If a user clicks a short URL, then the short form is exposed in the web log (as https://godbolt.org/g/SHORTURLPART ) and from this the source code can be
retrieved. As such, if you create a short URL of your code, your source
code and other user state can in principle be retrieved from the web log of Compiler Explorer. Compiler Explorer keeps a separate compile request log for Analytics purposes without identifying information.
This log only contains the settings which were used - minus code and options that may contain sensitive data. Compiler Explorer uses Amazon's web serving, load balancing and edge caching systems. In order to debug and diagnose
Compiler Explorer, to help track down and block Denial of Service attacks, and to gather statistics about Compiler
Explorer's performance and usage, the logs from these systems are archived. These logs contain the full IP addresses
of requests. They are kept for no more than one month, after which they are permanently deleted. If your web browser experiences an error, we use a third party reporting system ( Sentry ). This keeps information, including your IP address and web browser user agent, for no more than 90 days. Executing your code For certain configurations, we may support executing the results of your compilation on the Compiler Explorer
servers. Execution occurs in a heavily locked-down, isolated environment. We have made reasonable efforts to protect
both the Compiler Explorer site and other concurrently-processed requests from information leakage due to rogue
executions. Cookies Compiler Explorer uses small pieces of information stored on your computer: Cookies and Browser Local
Storage (and Session Storage). Local storage is used to remember the user's settings, source code and user interface configuration, so
that it's available when the user visits the Compiler Explorer site again. This information is not transmitted to
Compiler Explorer, except as described above in order to fulfil the user's requests. There is a separate document covering more on this. Your choices Compiler Explorer is an open source project. If you are concerned about any of the data protection measures outlined
above, or about what happens to your source code, you are encouraged to run your own local instance of Compiler
Explorer. Instructions on how to do this are on the GitHub project page . Compiler Explorer and the GDPR The Compiler Explorer team believes the Compiler Explorer site is compliant with the EU's General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR). Specifically, we store no personally identifying information, we anonymise the little data that
we do have and we do not permanently store any user data. Name and Address of the controller The Controller for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), other data protection laws

-->>-->>
Hi! I'm somewhat new to rust, although I have a lot of experience in other programming languages.    

   Over the years I've built a habit of being a "never-nester", which is to say as much as possible I try to avoid writing deeply-nested code.   

   For instance, as much as possible I prefer patterns like early returns, guard returns, early continues, etc.   

   ```rust   

   fn foo(a: i32) {
  if a < 0 {
    return;
  }

  if a % 2 == 0 {
    return;
  }

  for i in 0..a {
    if !filter(i) {
      continue;
    }

    // do logic here
  }
}
   

   ```   

   But one thing I've noticed in Rust is the prevalence of code like   

   ```rust   

   if let Some(foo) = map.get(&x) {
  if let Ok(bar) = foo.bar() {
    if let Bars::Space(qux, quz) = bar.bar_type {
      // do logic here
    }
  }
}
   

   ```   

   Now I know some of this can be alleviated with the    ?    operator, but not in all cases, and only in functions that return Option or Result, and when implementing library traits you can't really change the function signature at your whim.   

   So I've taken to doing a lot of this in my code:   

   ```rust   

   // in a function that doesn't return Option nor Result, and must not panic

let foo = map.get(&x);
if foo.is_none() {
  return;
}
let foo = foo.unwrap();

let bar = foo.bar();
if bar.is_err() {
  return;
}
let bar = bar.unwrap();

// can't un-nest Bars so no choice

if let Bars::Space(qux, quz) = bar.bar_type {
  // do logic here
}
   

   ```    

   But it seems like this isn't idiomatic. I'm wondering if there's a better way, or do experienced rust devs just "eat" the nesting and live with it?   

   Would love to hear from you.   

   Thanks!

I want to learn how to make a Wayland compositor using Rust but I can't find any resources. I read that    smithay    is primarily used to make a Wayland compositor and it also has a book but the book is quite short and not complete (   https://smithay.github.io/book/   ). Does anyone have experience in writing a Wayland compositor and knows where to start / where to get resources?

Repository files navigation README 🚀 Space Monitor Space Monitor is a Rust API for subscribing to real-time changes on Mac OS X to obtain the current active space (virtual desktop) index. Heavily inspired by the great work of George Christou and his Swift project - WhichSpace . 📚 Examples Check usage in the examples directory Async retrieval (event listener) use std :: thread ; use macos_space_monitor :: { MonitorEvent , SpaceMonitor } ; fn main ( ) { let ( monitor , rx ) = SpaceMonitor :: new ( ) ; let _monitoring_thread = thread :: spawn ( move || { while let Ok ( event ) = rx . recv ( ) { match event { MonitorEvent :: SpaceChange ( space ) => { println ! ( "Space change detected! Active space is: {}" , space ) ; } } } } ) ; monitor . start_listening ( ) ; } Sync retrieval use macos_space_monitor :: SpaceMonitor ; fn main ( ) { let space = SpaceMonitor :: get_current_space_number ( ) ; println ! ( "Current space: {}" , space ) ; } Why? This library was motivated by a fun project I am working on that deals with managing spaces in a more custom way on Mac OS X for more efficient space navigation. One of the core requirements when building space/window management tooling is to understand where you are within your display. This is a key crate I rely on to enable real-time lookups to map a virtual display ID to a space index. Building If you don't know Rust or aren't using Rust and simply just want a binary you can invoke from your own code, you can build the example directly and embed the binary or add it to your $PATH . Event Listener Version: Build: cargo build --release --example monitor Run: ./target/release/examples/monitor Adhoc Version: Build: cargo build --release --example adhoc Run: ./target/release/examples/adhoc 🧠 How it works Surprisingly, obtaining the active virtual desktop index is a non-trivial task on Mac OS X and attempts in doing so have been breaking release after release as the method relies on undocumented Mac OS native APIs. This method relies on a few key ingredients: Core Graphics (CG) We use CGSMainConnectionID to get a connection to the main window server The CGS (core graphics services) API is exploited to obtain this information FFI (Foreign function interface) Bridge for us to call the C APIs from Rust Cocoa Apple's native API for Mac OS apps NSApplication for background app Handle system notifications Objective-C Some message-passing invocations ( msg_send! ) Used for receiving event notifications Space monitor is essentially a Rust binding to access lower-level mac OS internal APIs in an easy and efficient way. While you can occassionally deciper some esoteric plist files to derive the active screen via defaults read com.apple.spaces SpacesDisplayConfiguration , the contents are almost always incorrect and out of date, which makes it a non-starter for realtime change detection. 🐦 Swift When I designed this crate, I wanted a minimal example I could iterate off of in Swift to simplify the migration into Rust since I'm not a Swift developer. Mostly just committing this for posterity, but you can find a much simpler implementation of this lib in Swift underneath the ./swift directory. Once again, this is heavily inspired by WhichSpace , but wanted to remove all the boilerplate. You can compile it via either of the following: ./swift/compile.sh swiftc -o SpaceMonitor CurrentSpace-types.swift CurrentSpace-main.swift CurrentSpace-delegate.swift Then just run: ./SpaceMonitor ⚠️ Warning As this crate relies on private, undocumented native Mac OS APIs internally, I believe your app would be rejected from the Apple app store if this crate is used within your application. However, users can still install the application externally.

-->>-->>
Hey    r/rust    👋   

   I’m excited to share Fennec, a new PHP toolchain inspired by Rust's tooling and philosophies. Fennec brings the robustness and developer-centric design of the Rust ecosystem to PHP, with features like linting, formatting, and static analysis.   

   After a couple of months of development, I’m open-sourcing Fennec. It’s super early, and all it can do right now is basic linting with only a few lint plugins and rules implemented. It’ll take a long time for it to take full shape, but you can try and test it now. The long-term goal is for Fennec to become a complete toolchain that modernizes PHP tooling.   

   I’d love any feedback on the project. Check out the code here:    github.com/carthage-software/fennec   

   Thanks for your thoughts and ideas as I work to bring Rust-inspired tools to PHP!

ContainerYard is a declarative, reproducible, and reusable decentralized approach for defining containers. Think Nix flakes meets Containerfiles (aka Dockerfiles).   

   Contianerfiles are divided into reusable configurable parts called "modules" and one can compose modules into containerfiles. e.g.   

   ```yaml
inputs:
  remotes:
    - url:    https://github.com/mcmah309/yard_module_repository   
      commit: 992eac4ffc0a65d7e8cd30597d93920901fbd1cd
      modules:
        base: bases/ubuntu/base
        git_config: independent/git_config
        bash_flavor: apt/bash_interactive/flavors/mcmah309   

   outputs:
  Containerfile1:
    - base:
        version: "24.04"
    - RUN apt install git
    - git_config:
        user_name: $(git config --get user.name)
        email: $(git config --get user.email)
    - bash_flavor:
  Containerfile2:
    - base:
        version: "22.04"
    - bash_flavor:   

   hooks:
  build:
    # Ensures everytime    yard build    is run, the    commit:    fields are updated
    pre: yard update
```
Write your config once and easily reuse and incrementally improve it over time.

I've seen some interest on here in state machine libraries, and since I needed a flexible one in my latest project, I figured that I'd write and publish it as my first serious open-source contribution.   

   Statement is a very flexible event-driven state machine, built with the intent of managing the state of potentially many entities of a type. Unlike some other state machine libraries that I've seen in the rust space, statement machines are defined at run-time, and can have side effects attached to the transitions that drive the application as entities change state.   

   Have a look, as always constructive criticism is welcome.

Hi,
After recently supporting 55% of llvm ir nodes, I worked on optimizing the generated assembly code and the wasm backend.   

   I also created a pr to godbolt so you can try out ygen live in your browser without needing to install anything:    https://godbolt.org/z/1bY3eq4EE   .   

   (I am only 13yrs old so the generated assembly code doesn't look that good)   

   Here's the GitHub:    https://github.com/Cr0a3/ygen    (please leave a ⭐)   

   Here are a few flags with which you can experiment a little:
 * -O turns on optimizations 
 * -triple="wasm64-unkown" uses the experimental wasm backend   

   The ir is a little different from llvm so you can refer to the ir code from one of the tests as a good reference:    https://github.com/Cr0a3/ygen/blob/main/tests%2Fshared_vars1.yl#L7-L33   

   (Sorry if the formatting is fucked up I am writing this from mobile)   

   Bye
